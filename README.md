## Rotten Knight Infos
Rotten Knight is a Rogue-Like Top Down Dungeon Crawler. In every dungeon there is a chest, an enemy and a portal that leads to the next dungeon. If you die, you loose everything you earned through chests, except for the spiritpoints earned during fights. Upgrade your stats or abilities in the Ascension Shop and become stronger every run.
